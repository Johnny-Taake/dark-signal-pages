## Kenney — service yards and parking additions

- Author: Kenney. License: [CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
- [Car Kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/car-kit): `van`, `delivery-flat`, `tractor-shovel`, stored as `vehicle-van.glb`, `vehicle-flatbed.glb`, `vehicle-loader.glb`.
- [Factory Kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/factory-kit): `machine-fortified`, `box-wide`, `conveyor-long-stripe`, `catwalk-stairs`, stored as `prop-generator.glb`, `prop-cargo-case.glb`, `prop-conveyor.glb`, `prop-metal-stairs.glb`.
- Downloaded from the author's website. Palette textures embedded; materials use rough, lit surfaces for the existing night lighting. Geometry preserved. Collision sections generated offline from these GLBs.

## Zsky — Shotgun Ammo

- Source: [Shotgun Ammo by Zsky](https://poly.pizza/m/7VSzqHwebM)
- License: [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)
- Local file: `assets/models/pickup-shotgun-shells.glb`.
- Modification: removed the source model's box primitives and rearranged one red shotgun cartridge with its brass base into three enlarged shells (two standing, one lying) above the game's ammunition box; scaled by standing-shell height for the pickup display.

## Quaternius — Zombie Apocalypse Kit

- Source: <https://quaternius.com/packs/zombieapocalypsekit.html>
- Author: Quaternius
- License: [CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
- Local files: `assets/models/*.gltf`
- Uses: animated infected variants, pickup, truck, barrels, first-person pistol, and AR.
- Multiplayer operators: `player-matt.gltf` and `player-lis.gltf`, from `Characters_Matt_SingleWeapon.gltf` and `Characters_Lis_SingleWeapon.gltf`. [Pack mirror](https://github.com/agentkaerf/FreeModels/tree/main/Zombie%20Apocalypse%20Kit%20-%20March%202024/Characters/glTF), used because the author's Drive download quota was exceeded. Original embedded geometry, textures and clips retained. Runtime hides handheld props, selects basic locomotion clips, and adds a seeded color patch and optional backpack. No first-person body is rendered.

The source pack permits use in personal and commercial projects. Attribution is not required by CC0, but the source is retained here for provenance.

All local files are under `assets/models/`. Pack-specific textures were embedded as data URIs inside each GLB to avoid external dependencies and collisions between identically named palette textures. Retro Urban materials were changed from unlit to rough, nonmetallic lit materials for the night scene; geometry was preserved. Some vehicle instances receive additional color tints.

## Nekis5_3D — Military Equipment Pack

- Source: [Military Equipment Pack – Helmets, Vests & Backpacks (FREE)](https://nekis5-3d.itch.io/military-equipment-pack-helmets-vests-backpacks-game-ready).
- Author: Nekis5_3D. The author permits personal and commercial use; credit is appreciated.
- Archive: `military ammunition.zip`; source scene: `bulletproof vest.fbx`, selected vest mesh `Cube002` and helmet mesh `Сфера001`.
- Local files: `assets/models/pickup-armor.glb` and `assets/models/enemy-helmet.glb`.
- Use: floating body-armor pickup in all game modes; helmet and vest variants for the rare armored infected.
- Adaptation: extracted only the required vest and helmet geometry, baked their static poses, removed unused skin attributes, normalized their scale, and applied matte olive materials for the game's night lighting. No source textures are required at runtime.
- Reproducible conversion: `scripts/import-armor-model.cjs` and `scripts/import-military-helmet.cjs` with the extracted archive directory and a local Vite server.
- Full archive inventory: [MILITARY_EQUIPMENT_PACK.md](MILITARY_EQUIPMENT_PACK.md).

## Recorded weapon handling audio

Pump-action and reload clips in `assets/audio/` use CC0 recordings by **zer0_sol** and **SpringySpringo**. Sources, exact original filenames, licensing and adaptations are documented in [assets/audio/LICENSE.md](assets/audio/LICENSE.md). Only mechanical handling sounds are taken from these recordings.

Grenade blasts use **Joth**'s [Chunky Explosion](https://opengameart.org/content/chunky-explosion), licensed CC0 1.0, edited for a shorter, softer high-frequency tail. See [assets/audio/LICENSE.md](assets/audio/LICENSE.md) for the conversion details.

Lis/Matt breathing and pain, and all creature voices, use CC0 recordings by AuraVoice, Ashe Kirk / Owlish Media, qubodup, Joseph SARDIN / BigSoundBank and Ogrebane. The 17 local clips, source links and adaptations are documented in [assets/audio/voices/LICENSE.md](assets/audio/voices/LICENSE.md); exact excerpts and source hashes are in `assets/audio/voices/provenance.json`. Profiles and extensible variant arrays live in `src/config/voices.js`.
